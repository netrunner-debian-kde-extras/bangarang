bangarang (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  [ Ryan Kavanagh ]
  * Jani no longer has copyrighted files in bangarang (blur.cpp was
    removed), removed him from the copyright file.
  * Updated copyright with new copyright holders
  * Added a manpage for the bangarangnepomukwriter executable
  * ~RC < ~beta2 < ~rc, we'll call our upload 1.0~rc-1 instead of 1.0~RC-1 so
    that dpkg doesn't complain about version order.
  * Changed section to Applications/Video, see bug #559895 for the
    history. (Closes: #546220)
  * Added a watch file
  * Added the Vcs-* entries to debian/control

  [ Andreas Marschke ]
  * Change the Maintainer to the Debian Multimedia Packages Maintainers and
    add my name and Ryan's to the Uploaders list
